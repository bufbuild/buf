- lots of QA, especially around workspace file searching, target paths
  - Test both dashful and dashless commit IDs
  - Lots of testing around b4 and b5 digests
- document behavior of file searching, config override

- update buf generate help documentation
- Rename `buf mod` commands?
  - `buf mod ls-lint-rules, ls-breaking-rules` do not work for multiple module workspaces
  - `buf mod init` is now really `config init`
  - `buf mod prune, update` is now really `buf workspace prune, update`

NOTE: We are not allowing cross-workspace finding for include_package_files=true

  // This is new post-refactor. Before, we gave precedence to --path. While a change,
  // doing --path foo/bar --exclude-path foo seems like a bug rather than expected behavior to maintain.

- Changed protoc-gen-buf-lint and protoc-gen-buf-breaking configuration, deprecated old configurations
- Need to manually test protoc-gen-buf-breaking
