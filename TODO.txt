- last commands:
  - export
  - format
  - generate
  - push
  - sync

- config override flag (finish, mostly in bufworkspace)
- v2 buf.yaml parsing in NewWorkspaceForBucket
- new digest format - figure out with API
- option to create workspace with no file searching (wkt)
  - Also use for when --config is used - force the current directory as the found directory
- new buf migrate command

- port tests from:
  - bufmodule
  - bufmoduleref
  - bufmoduletesting
  - bufmodulebuild
  - bufmoduleconfig
  - buflock
  - bufconfig

- lots of QA, especially around workspace file searching, target paths
- figure out what to do about AllowNotExist and how it fits in
- document behavior of file searching, config override
- fix tamper-proofing
- go through all todos
- decide whether it should be private/buf/bufmigrate or private/bufpkg/bufmigrate.
  It's in bufpkg temporarily only to make it easy to compile.
- `buf mod init` should create a v2 buf.yaml.
- Is `buf build` supposed to call the API when there is already a buf.lock? On the same
  directory, the released version (main) doesn't make that API call but `bufmod` calls
  `buf.registry.module.v1beta1.CommitService/GetCommitNodes`. Is it for computing digest? Or is it because the buf.lock is in v1?
