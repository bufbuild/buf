- lots of QA, especially around workspace file searching, target paths
  - Test both dashful and dashless commit IDs
  - Lots of testing around b4 and b5 digests
- document behavior of file searching, config override
- Make error messages more helpful in deprecation cases (ie in the help text, point to the new command)
- update buf generate help documentation

NOTE: We are not allowing cross-workspace finding for include_package_files=true

  // This is new post-refactor. Before, we gave precedence to --path. While a change,
  // doing --path foo/bar --exclude-path foo seems like a bug rather than expected behavior to maintain.

- Changed protoc-gen-buf-lint and protoc-gen-buf-breaking configuration, deprecated old configurations
- Need to manually test protoc-gen-buf-breaking
