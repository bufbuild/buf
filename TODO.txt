- last commands:
  - export
  - format
  - generate
  - push
  - sync

- new digest format - figure out with API
- new buf migrate command

- port tests from:
  - bufmodule
  - bufmoduleref
  - bufmoduletesting
  - bufmodulebuild
  - bufmoduleconfig
  - buflock
  - bufconfig

- lots of QA, especially around workspace file searching, target paths
- document behavior of file searching, config override
- fix tamper-proofing
- go through all todos

NOTE: We are not allowing cross-workspace finding for include_package_files=true

- Decide whether or not excludes and ignores should be relative to module directory

  // This is new post-refactor. Before, we gave precedence to --path. While a change,
  // doing --path foo/bar --exclude-path foo seems like a bug rather than expected behavior to maintain.
