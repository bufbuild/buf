- last commands:
  - export
  - format
  - generate
  - push
  - sync

- config override flag (finish, mostly in bufworkspace)
- v2 buf.yaml parsing in NewWorkspaceForBucket
- new digest format - figure out with API
- option to create workspace with no file searching (wkt)
  - Also use for when --config is used - force the current directory as the found directory
- new buf migrate command

- port tests from:
  - bufmodule
  - bufmoduleref
  - bufmoduletesting
  - bufmodulebuild
  - bufmoduleconfig
  - buflock
  - bufconfig

- lots of QA, especially around workspace file searching, target paths
- figure out what to do about AllowNotExist and how it fits in
- document behavior of file searching, config override
- fix tamper-proofing
- go through all todos
- Un-skip relevant tests in generate_test.go and generate_unix_test.go, when
  - the behavior of --path and --exclude-path is updated to match what's on main
- Debug the skipped test with proto file ref in generate_test.go
- Use syserror when possible (especially in buf gen related code).
- Find the right place (right way to pass a logger) to print a warning when a buf.gen.yaml with
  non-empty managed mode but without `enabled: true`. The key is to decide where to pass the logger.
- Fix the issue where reading a buf.lock with empty digest errors. Run `buf mod update` to reproduce.
