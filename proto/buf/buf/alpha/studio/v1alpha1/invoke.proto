// The buf.alpha.studio.v1alpha1 package contains types used by the buf studio
// agent. Because browsers are not capable of sending gRPC requests directly,
// users can run a studio agent to that receives enveloped requests from the
// browser and forwards them as gRPC requests.
//
// Ideally the agent would be simple protocol translating HTTP proxy without
// requiring any custom envelope. Unfortunately, js in the browser cannot set
// per request proxy configuration and we cannot specify that we want to open a
// connection to the request agent while specifying a different server in the
// request's Host header. The studio agent and UI could communicate this through
// a custom header instead, but reading custom headers requires a CORS-preflight
// request.
//
// To facilitate easier deployment it in environments with complicated edge
// configuration, it is a goal for the agent and UI to communicate without the
// need for a CORS-preflight requests. This limits our ability to use custom
// headers and restricts allowed values for the Content-Type header. Due to this
// we cannot simply use gRPC-Web with an additional header, but instead rely on
// enveloping the request and responses in a base64 encoded binary proto message
// sent over a POST endpoint with text/plain as Content-Type.
//
// We may explore other transports such as WebSockets or WebTransport, at which
// point we should define proper proto services and methods here as well.
