const tooManyFilesHelpMessage = `This is commonly caused by the maximum file limit being too low. Run "ulimit -n" to check your file limit. If this happened on generation, setting "strategy: all" for each configured plugin in your buf.gen.yaml can mitigate the issue if you are unable to change your file limit.`
