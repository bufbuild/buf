# Package stuff

## Notes

- Move `pkg` into own repo
- Move `bufpkg` into own repo
- Mark both `pkg` and `bufpkg` as `DO NOT USE` and never tag
- All buf-specific projects can (and should) use `pkg` and `bufpkg` where it makes sense
- Move `cmd` tools to github.com/bufbuild/tools

## Specific Packages

- `app`: Move `appproto` out of `app`
- `bandeps`: Move to tools
